### Testing animating routes in NextJS 13 (and app directory)

This is just a starter. Do with it what you want.

I was attempting to make CSS transitions between routes with the new 'app' directory. 
All the tutorials I found were still
using the old API with _app.tsx file.

Here, I'm using the React Context API, and then delaying the route change enough to let 
the current page animate out.
